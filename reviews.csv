4772,4,Excellent handset. I have some doubts about purchasing'6' inch phone. But when I hold this phone my doubts aregone away. Redi note 5 has a display of nearly '6' inchbut it can easily use with single hand. I don't feel a single lag on this phone while playing games or watching HD movies up to 4k. Touch screen is very responsive and reading books are so comfort with big display. Onydrawback is it's not loaded with Oreo.READ MORE
